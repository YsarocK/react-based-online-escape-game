# An online escape game built with React and Firebase

This is a project created by Remi Fernandez and Etienne Moureton for the Ecole Superieure du Digital (Bordeaux, France).
The playable version is available here : [http://homescape.diginight-esd-esp.com/#/].

## A 8-days building project

We, the two developpers that worked on the project didn't know React before beginning to build the escape game. We spent 8 days learning and building it followinga hard specifications book. It uses a lot of technologies (React, Firebase, Vanilla JS...).
The code is not clean at all, because we needed a working project, not a clean one. But in the incoming months, i'll release an updated version that will include responsive and cleaned code.

### How to use it ? `npm start`

If you want to run it locally, you will need to install dependecies with `npm i` and create a firebase.js config filewith your databse at the root of the src folder.
Run `npm start` then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
